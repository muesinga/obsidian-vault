Challenging role-- lots of things that person is in charge of.. service to entire organization-- similar to graphic design.

Randy is Creative Services manager

Web manager is all themselves.

All emails, all website, person Teanu-- Marketing side of tessitura..

built in Tess-- pulled in through Teanu

--

Cover letter; linked up with in person interview-- don't know that I meant for it to come across.. pointing out things that we weren't doing very well.

Written application could have counted against you.

Passion for music and organization came across in interview. 

Cover letter didn't do any favors.

Cover letter is opportunity to back up resume-- clearly states what I've done... these are the things that you are asking for, these are why I know I can do this.

Reason why this jobs would be a good fit for you. Experience from background.

Reading vs talking don't pick up on neuances; felt critical of work we were already doing. Why is so important. Concern, is might have put other people off.
