//** Google Ads Campaign Types **//

// SEARCH

Search ads appear next to Google search results and on other Google partner sites, like YouTube, when people look for businesses like yours.

example: The brand used data from their customer loyalty program to target Google Search ads and create a strategy to bid on users differently at various stages of the purchase journey, while also driving down their cost-per-booking.

// DISPLAY

Google Display ads can appear across a network of more than two million sites and apps, reaching 90% of people on the internet. Your ads get matched to content related to your business or to your customers' interests.

example: As part of their campaign, WE chose to use YouTube to maximize their reach. Their YouTube campaign ran for one month and used a variety of ad formats and targeting techniques, including Remarketing, In-Market, and Affinity Audiences. In that time, WE achieved 80% reach among their intended audience, helping them increase overall awareness. To top it off, their ads saw an average watch time that was 484% better than similar campaigns theyâ€™d run in the past.

// SHOPPING

Shopping ads appear on Google Shopping next to search results and near text and responsive ads. Shopping ads promote your products by giving consumers detailed information about what you're selling before they even select your ad.

Use a Shopping campaign to advertise your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better-qualified leads.

// APP

After a simple setup process, App campaigns run ads across Google's largest properties, including Search, Play, and YouTube, as well as thousands of mobile sites and apps. Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads. Just add a few lines of text, a bid, and some assets, and the rest is optimized to help customers find you.

//** Optimize your campaign **//

While the campaign type you choose determines where users see your ads, you can customize plenty of features to make sure you engage the most meaningful audiences.

-- Device Targeting

-- Locations and language targeting

-- Bidding and budget settings: your bid strategy controls how you pay for users to interact with your ads. Your bid limit is the most that you'll pay per click for ads in an ad group, and your budget is the average amount that you're comfortable spending each day on your campaign. The budget that you choose is entirely up to you, and you can adjust it at any time.

-- Ad extensions: include even more information with your ads, such as location details, links to pages on your website, and your phone number.
