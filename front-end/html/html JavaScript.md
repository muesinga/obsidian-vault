//** HTML JavaScript **//

JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

-- The HTML `<script>` Tag --

The HTML `<script` tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).

The `<script>` element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the `src` attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the `document.getElementById()` method.

This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

```
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
```

-- The HTML `<noscript>` Tag --

The HTML `<noscript>` tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts.
