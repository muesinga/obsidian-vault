//** HTML Block & Inline **//

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of elements it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.

-- Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The `<div>` element is a block-level element.

Here are the block level elements in HTML:

```
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<fieldset>
<figure>
<footer>
<form>
<h1>-<h6>
<header>
<hr>
<li>
<main>
<nav>
<noscript>
<ol>
<p>
<pre>
<section>
<table>
<tfoot>
<ul>
<video>
```

-- Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:

```
<a>
<abbr>
<acronym>
<b>
<bdo>
<big>
<br>
<button>
<cite>
<code>
<dfn>
<em>
<i>
<img>
<input>
<kbd>
<label>
<map>
<object>
<output>
<q>
<samp>
<script>
<select>
<small>
<span>
<strong>
<sub>
<sup>
<textarea>
<time>
<tt>
<var>
```

-- The `<div>` Element
	
The `<div>` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The `<div>` element had no required attributes, but `style`, `class`, and `id` are common.

When used together with CSS, the `<div>` element can be used to style blocks of content.

-- The `<span>` Element

The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The `<span>` element had no required attributes, but `style`, `class`, and `id` are common.
