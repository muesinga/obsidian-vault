//** HTML Symbols **//

Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.

-- HTML Symbol Entities --

HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity not present on a normal keyboard. 

To add such sumbols to an HTML page you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

//** HTML Emojis **//

Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set

-- What are Emojis --

Empjis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

-- The HTML charset Attribute --

To display an HTML page correctly a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

The is specified in the `<meta>` tag

`<meta charset="UTF-8">`

-- UTF-8 Characters --

Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers).

Emoji are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet.

Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML.
